# SAS Viya 4 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Overview

This project contains Terraform scripts to provision AWS Cloud infrastructure resources required to deploy SAS Viya 4 products. Here is a list of resources this project can create -

  >- Amazon VPC and Security Group
  >- Managed Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS)
  >- Self-Managed Node Groups with required Labels and Taints
  >- Infrastructure to deploy SAS Viya CAS in SMP or MPP mode

## Prerequisites

Operational knowledge of:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)

### Required

- Access to **AWS account** with a user associated with the supplied [IAM Policy](./files/devops-iac-eks-policy.json)
- Subscription to [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - Bionic](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07CQ33QKV/)
- Terraform or Docker
  
  - #### Terraform

    - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - v0.13.6
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - v1.18.8
    - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - v1.6
    - [AWS CLI v2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) - (optional -useful as an alternative to the AWS Web Console) - v2.1.20
  
  - #### Docker
  
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is the operating system used on the Jump/NFS servers. Ubuntu creates the `/mnt` location as an ephemeral drive and cannot be used as the root location of the `jump_rwx_filestore_path` variable.

### Clone this project

Run these commands in a Terminal session:

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-iac-aws
cd viya4-iac-aws
```

### Authenticating Terraform to access AWS

See  [Authenticating Terraform to access AWS](./docs/user/TerraformAWSAuthentication.md) for details.

### Customize Input Values

Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` to customize any input variable value. For starters, you can copy one of the provided sample variable definition files in [examples](./examples) folder. For more details on the variables declared in [variables.tf](variables.tf) refer to [CONFIG-VARS.md](docs/CONFIG-VARS.md).

**NOTE:** You will need to update the `cidr_blocks` in the [variables.tf](variables.tf) file to allow traffic from your current network. Without these rules, access to the cluster will only be allowed via the AWS Console.

When using a variable definition file other than `terraform.tfvars`, see [Advanced Terraform Usage](docs/user/AdvancedTerraformUsage.md) for additional command options.

## Creating and Managaging the Cloud Resources

Create and manage the AWS cloud resources by either

- using [Terraform](docs/user/TerraformUsage.md) directly on your workstation, or
- using a [Docker container](docs/user/DockerUsage.md).

## Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting](./docs/Troubleshooting.md) page for help with some frequently found issues.
